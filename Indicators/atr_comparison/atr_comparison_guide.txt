We expand ATR to an improved version that helps us compare the volatilities of different symbols at the same time in one chart.

How it works?

We implemented two indicators, one is used to export the data you want to aggregate, such as EURUSD H1 and AUDUSD H1, so you need to add the atr_exporter to EURUSD H1 and AUDUSD H1 both charts.
There is a parameter named "name".
You need to set this parameter to make the other indicator atr_comparison identify the charts you are referring to.
You can set the name for EURUSD H1 chart to "chart1", you can set the name for AUDUSD H1 to "chart2".
And then, you add atr_comparison to either of the two charts. Let's say EURUSD H1.
atr_comparison has two parameters, one should be set "chart1" to make it point to EURUSD H1, the other one should be set "chart2" to make it point to AUDUSD H1.
Finally, you put both charts data in one indicator window, and now you can monitor the differences of the fluctuations to find the chance.

This indicator only supports two symbols. You can expand it to be able to monitor more symbols by just a little editing the original version.
