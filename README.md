## Usage

I received a lot of questions that asked how to use the Javasacript files in this repository.
Actually, the usage is different from Nodejs, so, you DON'T need to use "node xxx.js" to run it.
And, it's much EASIER to run them. Because they are browser-based, so, what you need to do is just open the WEB trader of Fintechee and copy-paste the source codes into the CONSOLE panel of the WEB trader and then click the RUN button. Then everything is DONE.
Each file in this repo is indepenedent to each other. You can use them respectively.

### Release Notes
2020.7.7 three APIs were modified and added parameters.
1. sendOrder
2. modifyOrder
3. closeTrade

2021.2.22 Added one API to improve the performance.
1. getCurrentTick

2021.3.3 two APIs were modified.

1. registerIndicator

We Added three parameters to this API. They are all callback functions: OnInit, OnDeinit, and OnRender. We added them to extend the functions in Fintechee and make our indicators much easier to manage and monitor. When you add an indicator to the chart, the OnInit callback function would be called. When you remove an indicator from the chart, the OnDeinit function would be called. After the main callback function is called, the OnRender function would be triggered. The OnRender function is very useful to add your own renderer to the platform. Our platform's renderer is based on D3js. If you are not familiar with it, you can use other alternative JS chart systems, such as ChartJS.

And, these callback functions are new features. Other platforms have no these parameters. Fortunately, this API is compatible with the older versions, so, you don't need to modify your old indicators.

2. registerEA

We added one more parameter to this API, it's a callback function to receive a message when the transaction was triggered.
For example, if you send an order to the backend, you don't need to block your process. Everything on our platform is ASYNC. So, you can continue to do analysis and just make this callback function available to wait for the notification from the backend. If the order is filled and a new trade is opened, then you will get notified.

And, this callback function is a new feature. Other platforms have no this parameter. Fortunately, this API is compatible with the older versions, so, you don't need to modify your old EAs.

2021.9.18 Added three APIs useful when the onTransaction event is triggered.
1. getLatestTransBrokerName
2. getLatestTransAccountId

		i--
	} else {
		for (var j = 0; j < period - 1; j++) {
			dataOutput[j] = 0
		}

		i = period - 1
	}

	var sum = 0

	for (var j = i - period + 1; j < i; j++) {

		i++
	} else if (i == 1) {
	} else {
		i--
	}

	if (i > 0) {
		i--
	} else {
		i = period - 1

		for (var j = 1; j < period; j++) {
			dataOutput[i - j] = 0
			sum += dataInput[i - j]
		}

		sum += dataInput[i]
		dataOutput[i] = sum / period
		i++
	}

	while (i < dataInput.length) {
		sum = dataOutput[i - 1] * period - dataOutput[i - 1] + dataInput[i]
		dataOutput[i] = sum / period
		i++
	}
}

function lwma (dataInput, dataOutput, calculatedLength, period) {

		diffsum += dataInput[i - j]
		weight += j
	}
	weight += period
