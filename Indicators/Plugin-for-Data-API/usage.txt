This folder includes programs used for integrating with data providers, specifically crypto data providers.

We plan to refactor the programs within this folder. Additionally, the program for connecting with the Oanda API, which was previously located in this folder, has been moved to a new directory named Plugin-for-Oanda. This directory has also undergone refactoring. If you need to reference the structure of a data provider's connectivity, we suggest referring to Plugin-for-Oanda.
