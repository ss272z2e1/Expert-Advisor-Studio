Use Case: A provides signals, B follows the signals from A to copy trade. Both accounts are Fintechee-based.

How to do?
1. A shares A's investor password with B.
Please note, enabling investor mode is not required for this step.
If you enable investor mode, then everyone can check your trading records.
If you disable investor mode(disabled by default), then only the followers that know your investor password can check your trading records.

2. B signs into both accounts.
B signs into A's account by entering A's investor password.
B signs into B's own account by entering B's password.

3. B launches copy_trading_locally via Fintechee WEB Trader.
If copy_trading_locally doesn't exist, you can get it on Fintechee's Github repo:
https://github.com/fintechees/Expert-Advisor-Studio/blob/master/EA/CopyTrading/copy_trading_locally.js
Copy the source codes and paste them into Fintechee WEB Trader's Javascript console and run it.
Then you can find it listed on the EA list and launch it.
There are two parameters: fromAccountId and toAccountId.
B sets fromAccountId to A's account ID and sets toAccountId to B's account ID.

Done!
