## News!!

### FiSDK

We recently released FiSDK, a tool specifically designed for managing the backend. This tool features APIs that are entirely distinct from the APIs used for EA/indicators (Charting System). The APIs provided in this repository are mainly designed for quant traders to stay ahead of market movements and generate trading signals. FiSDK’s APIs, on the other hand, are primarily intended for position monitoring in the backoffice.

For more information on FiSDK, please check out this repository: https://github.com/fintechees/fisdk

Please note that the examples provided in the fisdk repository cannot be used in the WEB-trader’s console panel, and the examples provided here cannot be used in the fisdk repository.

### Payment Gateway

We have successfully integrated with BitCartCC (https://bitcartcc.com, https://github.com/bitcartcc/bitcart), one of the most promising payment platforms available. It’s worth mentioning that the platform’s founder, Alex, is only 18 years old as of 2022!

### Marketplace(multi-vendor) for EA

Our new marketplace for EA developers, Fintechee.io, allows you to sell all types of digital products, not just C/C++/Mql based EAs/indicators. The digital signature technology we use ensures that copyright is protected, and each download link expires a few minutes after the order is created.

We launched on Aug. 12th, 2022, and we’ve already listed an EA called SimpleScalping in production for just $10. The algorithm is based on Martingale and is very stable on a larger timeframe with sufficient patience.

Currently, our payment gateway(for the EA marketplace, not for the WEB-trader) is connected to PayPal’s sandbox. If you have a PayPal test (developer) account, you can obtain any EA for free.

### FIX Bridge(an individual version of WEB trader's backend)

we have developed a new version of our FIX Bridge feature for individual traders. It’s free FOREVER!

Download link:
https://www.fintechee.com/assets/fix-api/fintecheefixbridge.7z

## Usage

I have received several questions about how to utilize the JavaScript files in this repository. However, the usage is not the same as Node.js, so it is unnecessary to use “node xxx.js” to run them. In fact, it’s a much simpler process, as our files are browser-based. All you need to do is open the Fintechee Web Trader, copy and paste the relevant source codes into the Console Panel, and then click the Run Button. It’s that easy!

Each file in this repository is independent and can be used separately. The EAs and indicators are stored solely on your browser and are never uploaded to the server side. We use Web LocalStorage to ensure that the secrets of your trading strategies are protected.

### Release Notes
2020.7.7 three APIs were modified and added parameters.
1. sendOrder
2. modifyOrder
3. closeTrade

2021.2.22 Added one API to improve the performance.
1. getCurrentTick

2021.3.3 two APIs were modified.

1. registerIndicator

We added three parameters to this API, all of which are callback functions: OnInit, OnDeinit, and OnRender. We added these to extend the functionality of Fintechee and make it easier to manage and monitor indicators. When you add an indicator to the chart, the OnInit callback function will be called. When you remove an indicator from the chart, the OnDeinit function will be called. After the main callback function is executed, the OnRender function will be triggered. The OnRender function is particularly useful if you want to add your own renderer to the platform. Our platform’s renderer is based on D3.js. If you are not familiar with it, you can use other alternative JS charting systems such as Chart.js.

These callback functions are new features; other platforms do not have these parameters. Fortunately, this API is compatible with older versions, so you do not need to modify your old indicators.

Example:
https://github.com/fintechees/Expert-Advisor-Studio/blob/master/Indicators/chart_elements/line_segment_sample.js

2. registerEA

We have added a new parameter to this API, namely a callback function that receives a message when a transaction is triggered. For instance, if you want to send an order to the backend and avoid blocking your process, everything on our platform runs asynchronously. Therefore, you can continue with your analysis and leave this callback function in place to receive a notification from the backend when the order is executed and a new trade is opened.

This callback function is a new feature; other platforms do not offer this parameter. Fortunately, this API is backward compatible, so you don’t need to modify your old EAs.

Example:
https://github.com/fintechees/Expert-Advisor-Studio/blob/master/EA/CopyTrading/copy_trading_for_oanda.js

2021.9.18 Added three APIs useful when the onTransaction event is triggered.
1. getLatestTransBrokerName
2. getLatestTransAccountId
3. getLatestTrans

2022.11.2 Added one API useful when you want to combine several EAs into a workflow.
1. launchEA
