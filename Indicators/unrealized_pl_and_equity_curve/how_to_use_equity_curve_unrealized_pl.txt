Almost all the indicators' charts are based on candlesticks or another indicator's output.
We can use almost all the indicators independently.

But equity_curve and unrealized_pl are different from the common indicators.
Their data are generated by the account information, such as equity and unrealized profit/loss.
And, our APIs to get the account information can be used only in the EAs.
So, we need an EA to serve as an assistant to transfer the account infomation from APIs used by EAs to indicators.

If you check the current folder, you can find equity_curve_viewer and unrealized_pl_viewer that serve as the assistants.

Our trading platform has a very convenient function. You can specify the indicators used in an EA and get the indicators' output by controlling the handles of the indicators.
So, if you launch the EA that retrieves some indicators' output, the indicators will be loaded and attached to the chart automatically.

If you want to use equity_curve or unrealized_pl, what you need to do is to run equity_curve_viewer or unrealized_pl_viewer(please note both equity_curve_viewer and unrealized_pl_viewer are EAs, not indicators).
Then equity_curve or unrealized_pl will be loaded and attached to the chart.
You can add other indicators to the charts in the same way.(Of course, you can add other indicators by choosing them on the toolbar menu as well. This way is more common.)
