One of the key features of Fintechee is its extensibility. The platform comes equipped with built-in chart elements such as the line element and Fibonacci. You can even create your own chart elements on the fly. chart_elements is not only a manager for customized elements but also a reference for you to refer to. It's worth noting that chart_elements is still under maintenance, so we may update it in the future. To avoid being overwritten, please rename the file and then edit it.
