- Open your C/C++ file and then click "Generate Indicator" or "Generate EA". C/C++ source codes and a JSON string will be generated. You can modify your original source codes by the generated codes. The generated parts are used to define the meta information of your program, such as the variables and data output and can be helpful to make your original codes compilable.
