Use Case: A provides signals, B follows the signals from A to copy trade. A's account is a Fintechee-based account, B's account is an Oanda-based account.

How to do?
1. A shares A's investor password with B.
Please note, enabling investor mode is not required for this step.
If you enable investor mode, then everyone can check your trading records.
If you disable investor mode(disabled by default), then only the followers that know your investor password can check your trading records.

2. B signs into both accounts.
B signs into A's account by entering A's investor password.
B signs into B's Oanda-based account by launching an EA named oanda_loader.
You can get oanda_loader on Fintechee's Github repo:
https://github.com/fintechees/Expert-Advisor-Studio/blob/master/Indicators/Plugin-for-Data-API/oanda_loader.js
Oanda issues a token as login credential. So, B needs to input it into the corresponding parameter for oanda_loader.

3. B launches copy_trading_for_oanda via Fintechee WEB Trader.
copy_trading_for_oanda is a built-in EA.
There are no parameters because the EA will follow all the signals that it receives and trade via B's Oanda account.
B has logged into A's account in the investor mode, so all the signals that A issues will be seen by B.
The EA will send orders via the plugin oanda_loader launched in the 2nd step.

Done!
