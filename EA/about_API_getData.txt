Let me share a very important point to use the API getData.
We didn't update this API's specs, so, no need to sync your codes.

We have an API to set the shift value for indicators to make the indicator shift to the left or to the right.
The API is called setIndiShift.

Even if you call this API - setIndiShift in your custom indicator codes,  the data received by calling getData in your EA codes will have no difference.

For example:
You call setIndiShift(context, "sma", 5) in your custom moving average codes to make the MA shift to the right by 5 units.
And then you call getData in your EA codes to get the edited MA's data.
The return array data will be the same as the return array from calling a custom MA with setIndiShift(context, "sma", 0)

Why?
Because Fintechee ignores the effect of setIndiShift when getData is called.
So, if you want to get the latest value of the MA with setIndiShift(context, "sma", 5), you need to specify the index reduced by 5(such as arrData[arrLen - 1 - 5]).
arrData[arrLen - 1] will get the latest value of the MA with setIndiShift(context, "sma", 0).

Not clear?
Okay, let me give a detailed example.
We have an indicator xxx that contains an array of ten values, 1, 2, 3,..., 7, 8, 9, 10.
When we call setIndiShift(context, "xxx", 3) to make xxx shift to the right by 3 units, the array of the data still is the same as xxx with setIndiShift(context, "xxx", 0).
So, if we want to get the latest value of xxx with setIndiShift(context, "xxx", 0), we use arrData[arrLen - 1] and get 10.
If we want to get the latest value of xxx with setIndiShift(context, "xxx", 3), then we use arrData[arrLen - 1 - 3] and get 7.
No matter what shift is entered when we call setIndiShift, the return array of getData is the same.
